## üîç Analysis of AI Decisions

### What the AI Got Right
1. **Risk Management**: Proper stop-loss placement at ~15% below entry
2. **Diversification**: Spread across different sectors (tech + biotech)  
3. **Position Sizing**: Reasonable allocation (~40% + 35% of portfolio)
4. **Fundamental Analysis**: Considered earnings, catalysts, technical levels

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Market Timing**: Bought on a slightly down day
2. **Sector Concentration**: Both positions in higher-risk growth sectors
3. **Cash Management**: Left very little cash for opportunities

### User Decision Quality

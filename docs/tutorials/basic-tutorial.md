Now it loads your existing portfolio:
```
üöÄ Starting ChatGPT Micro-Cap Trading Bot
==================================================
üìÅ Data directory: Scripts and CSV Files
üìä Portfolio file: Scripts and CSV Files/chatgpt_portfolio_update.csv
üë§ Mode: Manual trading only
==================================================

   ticker  shares  stop_loss  buy_price  cost_basis
0    ABEO    10.0       4.89       5.75       57.50
1    CADL     8.0       4.03       5.04       40.32
```

### Daily Updates
The system automatically:
- ‚úÖ Fetches current prices for your stocks
- ‚úÖ Checks if any stop-losses were triggered
- ‚úÖ Updates your portfolio value
- ‚úÖ Calculates performance metrics
- ‚úÖ Saves everything to CSV files

### Stop-Loss Example
If a stock drops below your stop-loss:
```
ABEO closing price: 4.85  # Below your 4.89 stop-loss!
Action: SELL - Stop Loss Triggered
```

The system automatically:
- Sells the position at your stop-loss price
- Adds cash back to your account
- Logs the trade with loss/gain
- Removes the stock from your portfolio

## üéØ Understanding Key Concepts

### Stop-Loss Protection
- **What**: Automatic sale when price drops to set level
- **Why**: Limits losses on bad trades
- **Example**: Buy at $5.75, stop-loss at $4.89 = max 15% loss

### Position Sizing
- **Small positions**: Less risk, less reward
- **Large positions**: More risk, more reward
- **Diversification**: Multiple positions reduce risk

### Performance Metrics
- **Total Return**: How much you've gained/lost
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted performance
- **Benchmark Comparison**: How you're doing vs market

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Beginner Mistakes

### ‚ùå Avoid These
1. **No stop-losses**: Always set them!
2. **Position too large**: Don't risk >20% on one stock
3. **No diversification**: Don't put all money in one stock
4. **Emotional trading**: Stick to your plan
5. **Ignoring data**: Review your performance regularly

### ‚úÖ Best Practices
1. **Start small**: Learn with amounts you can afford to lose
2. **Set stop-losses**: 15-20% below entry is common
3. **Diversify**: 3-7 positions maximum
4. **Keep records**: The system does this automatically
5. **Review regularly**: Learn from wins and losses

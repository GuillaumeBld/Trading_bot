# AI Trading Research Initiative

##  Research Overview

**Objective**: Advance the state-of-the-art in AI-powered trading through systematic research and experimentation  
**Timeline**: Ongoing with quarterly reviews  
**Focus Areas**: Model performance, strategy optimization, risk management, and market prediction

##  Current Research Questions

### 1. AI Model Performance in Micro-Cap Markets
**Research Question**: How do different LLM architectures perform in micro-cap stock analysis compared to large-cap markets?

**Hypothesis**: Smaller, specialized models may outperform larger general models in micro-cap analysis due to:
- Less noise from mainstream financial media
- More focus on fundamental analysis vs sentiment
- Different risk/reward dynamics

**Methodology**:
- Compare GPT-4, Claude, Llama, and fine-tuned models
- Track recommendation accuracy over 6+ months
- Analyze performance by market cap, sector, and volatility
- Control for market conditions and timing

**Success Metrics**:
- Recommendation accuracy (% profitable trades)
- Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio)
- Maximum drawdown prevention
- Consistency across market conditions

### 2. Multi-Model Ensemble Strategies
**Research Question**: Can combining multiple AI models improve trading performance beyond single-model approaches?

**Hypothesis**: Ensemble methods will reduce model-specific biases and improve overall performance through:
- Diverse reasoning approaches
- Error cancellation across models
- Confidence calibration improvements
- Robustness to individual model failures

**Methodology**:
- Implement voting mechanisms (majority, weighted, confidence-based)
- Test different model combinations
- Compare ensemble vs individual model performance
- Analyze disagreement patterns and resolution strategies

**Expected Outcomes**:
- 15-30% improvement in risk-adjusted returns
- Reduced volatility in recommendations
- Better calibration of confidence scores
- More robust performance across market regimes

### 3. Real-Time Market Sentiment Integration
**Research Question**: How can real-time news, social media, and market data improve AI trading recommendations?

**Current Limitations**:
- Models trained on static data
- Limited real-time market context

- Missing catalyst identification

**Research Approach**:
- Integrate news APIs (Alpha Vantage, NewsAPI)
- Social media sentiment analysis (Twitter, Reddit)
- Real-time market data (volume, volatility)
- Event detection and catalyst identification

**Technical Implementation**:
- Streaming data pipelines
- Real-time sentiment scoring
- Context-aware prompting
- Dynamic model adjustment

### 4. Custom Fine-Tuning for Trading
**Research Question**: Can domain-specific fine-tuning improve trading recommendation quality?

**Training Data Sources**:
- Historical trade logs with outcomes
- Financial statements and earnings data
- Market commentary and analyst reports
- Technical analysis patterns and results

**Fine-Tuning Approaches**:
- Supervised learning on profitable trades
- Reinforcement learning with trading rewards
- Few-shot learning with domain examples
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA, adapters)

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- Out-of-sample trading performance
- Generalization to new market conditions
- Computational efficiency vs performance trade-offs
- Robustness to market regime changes

##  Active Experiments

### Experiment 1: Confidence Calibration Study
**Status**: In Progress  
**Duration**: 3 months (Started: August 2024)  
**Sample Size**: 500+ AI recommendations

**Objective**: Improve the accuracy of AI confidence scores

**Methodology**:
1. Track AI confidence scores (0-1) for all recommendations
2. Measure actual outcomes (profitable vs unprofitable)
3. Analyze calibration curves (predicted vs actual success rates)
4. Develop calibration corrections

**Preliminary Results** (1 month):
- High confidence (>0.8): 72% success rate vs 80% predicted
- Medium confidence (0.5-0.8): 58% success rate vs 65% predicted  
- Low confidence (<0.5): 45% success rate vs 45% predicted

**Insights**:
- Models are overconfident at high confidence levels
- Good calibration at low confidence levels
- Need post-hoc calibration adjustments

- **Fundamental Only**: Financials, ratios, growth metrics
- **Combined**: Both technical and fundamental data
- **Catalyst-Driven**: Focus on news and events

**Metrics**:
- Win rate and average returns
- Risk-adjusted performance
- Maximum drawdown
- Consistency across time periods
